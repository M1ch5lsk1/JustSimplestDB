<p>If you wanna initialize JustSimplestDB, you need to create an instance.</p>
<p>Instance is occurence of object with specific values, like x = Human("John", "Doe") and y = Human("Joanna", "Doe"), <br>
  both are Human class occurence, but what make them different, is given values to them, that's what make them object instance, object is occurence of class with specific values.</p>
